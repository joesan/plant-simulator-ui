# power-simulator
A simple simulator app that simulates the operation of a power producing plant

For simplicity, this simulator assumes that there are essentially two types of power producing
plants:

1. A PowerPlant that is steerable by turning it on or off (ex., battery)
2. A PowerPlant that is steerable by ramping it up (ex., generators, gas turbines)
